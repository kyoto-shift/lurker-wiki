# Dokuwiki Plugin Fields
This Dokuwiki plugin allows you to define “fields” in a page, which can be used anywhere in the document.
This can be very useful to set an author name, a reference string, or a version number for example,
and use those variables anywhere in the page.

The original author is Aurelien Bompard (aurelien@bompard.org).
