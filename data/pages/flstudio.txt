FL Studio (formerly known as FruityLoops) is a digital audio workstation (DAW) developed by the Belgian company Image-Line. FL Studio features a graphical user interface based on a pattern-based music sequencer. The program is available in three different editions for Microsoft Windows, including Fruity Edition, Producer Edition, and the Signature Bundle. Image-Line offers lifetime free updates to the program, which means customers receive all future updates of the software for free. Image-Line also develops FL Studio Mobile for iPod Touch, iPhone, iPad and Android devices. There is also a beta available for Mac operating systems.
