Lurker is an open source music production wiki, originally created by Judah (Kyotoshift). The original goal for Lurker was to be a place for all producers---regardless of skill---to make the learning aspects of music production more approachable, as well as 100% free. Unfortunately Judah was unable to maintain Lurker, thus making it open source for anyone to build upon it.
