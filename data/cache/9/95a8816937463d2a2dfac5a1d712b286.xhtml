<p>
This panel enables you to add and delete macros and their replacement texts, and to edit them after they have been saved.  A macro name can contain letters, numbers, underscores, hyphens and periods. For example: <code>Macro_one.txt</code>. The replacement texts can accept <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and can be of any length.
</p>

<p>
You can add up to six macros at a time.  The sixth is a text area which will allow for extended texts.
Enter the macro name in the <strong>Macro</strong> column and the texts which they represent in the
<strong>Substitution</strong> column. 
</p>

<p>
Deletions are unlimited; check off the box(es) next the macro(s) to be deleted and click
the <strong>Delete</strong> button at the bottom of the screen. Editing is done through the Edit screen, where you are presented
with all your macros.  You can edit the texts of any number of macros.
</p>

<p>
The macro list will not refresh until after you have submitted your edits, additions, or deletions
by clicking the appropriate button at the bottom of the screen.
